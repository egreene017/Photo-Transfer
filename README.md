# Photo-Transfer

This program makes it easier for my parents to put photos on their computer. Currently, they have to manually type the date and Name of the photo for each one of their photos that they put into their computer. I'm hoping after this to automate it for them and make the process a little bit faster.

This is the format they use:

YY-MM-DD Name_of_Event ii

YY-MM-DD:      The date the photo was taken; ex: 17-10-25  (October 25, 2017)
Name_of_Event: The name of the photo; ex: Denali
ii:            The index of the photo since there's more than one of the same photo
Full example of photo name:  17-10-25 Denali 07

-The user enters a directory into the program
-The user enters in the date and name of the event
-The program goes into the specified directory and changes the name of each photo inside
